Kashing allows you to easily integrate Kashing Smart Payment Technology with your WordPress website.

== Description ==
Start accepting secure card payments instantly with the Kashing plugin on your WordPress website. The plugin works across all browsers and with desktop, tablet and mobile devices. Itâ€™s so quick and easy to set up that you can do it yourself in no time. 

All the transactions are logged though your Kashing membership account and are available for you to view and search anytime. 

Never miss out on an online sale again.

Do you sometimes need to sell things face-to-face as well? Have a look at the Kashing Smart App and ditch your old fashioned card reader.
